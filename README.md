# Network_Verification

-generate network on MAC because widlcard-*.so is compatible to Mac
through config parser. 


-run Make on Linux machines, because Mac doesnt support PTHREAD in GNU


loop around reachablity code from port-map to check the possibility. 



We can run netplumber on MacOS (again because of .so file.) 
Make sure you change the utils folder.
